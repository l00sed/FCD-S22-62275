we investigated opportunities of facade panels reacting according to their distance from the sun. As our installation is located in Pittsburgh, PA, USA, southern facade of the structure will receive much more sunlight. Therefore, our installation performs an operation of colsing parts of the facade panels that are the closest to the sun to prevent extremely hot temperature that occupants might feel. The shape of the installation took inspirations from the inclusive envrionment Carnegie Mellon has provided to the student community, and it serve to remind occupants that we are a strong community together.

In this case, we choose to represent our design through detailed diagrams and digital fabrication with CNC machine. For our digital fabrication, we choose a typical node from our space frame which consist of two perpendicular steel bars and two slanted steel bars at a 15 degree angle. 
## Toolpath

## Instructions for Use

This project uses a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xx-BAiJOEaJtxtih9Y5A21Z39kpJK6yz/view?usp=sharing">Grasshopper</a> script&mdash; which is a file that contains the algorithm to generatively design our spaceframe. You must have Rhino 6 or 7 to open the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bM4RsLYVoZxPGBMB9QUbIUNgtJYaGrF9/view?usp=sharing"> rhino 6&7 file</a> file.

**Dependencies**

The _Grasshopper_ script uses:
  - Lunchbox
  - Ladybug
  - Pufferfish

Install these dependencies and then open the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xx-BAiJOEaJtxtih9Y5A21Z39kpJK6yz/view?usp=sharing"> grasshopper file</a> file in Rhino3D.
