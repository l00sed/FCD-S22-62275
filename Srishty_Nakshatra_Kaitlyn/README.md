###### The Diamond Parametric structure is located on the front lawn of CFA. The structure is meant to be a zone of relaxation and shade from the sunlight. During hot summer days, students may find themselves laying under the structure after a long day of stressful work. Though the structure provides vast amounts of shade, itâ€™s most appearant feature is spotlightof sunlight that shines through the structure. This spotlight is created by the open panels concentrated on the facade.

**Parameters to Change**

* Input brep - the base geometry where the overall form of the structure is derived from and what the space fram and panels are based on.   
* Rows - The number of rows that are in the space frame chages based on the U direction. 

* Columns - The number of columns that are in the space frame changes based on the V direction. 

* Pipe Thickness - Determines the thickness of the pipes which form the space frame. 

**Script Dependencies**

The Grasshopper script included the add on LunchBox. 



**3D Assets and Organization**

The grasshopper script works by taking a base form and taking a base form and creating a space frame. The space frame was created by by using the diamond panels component and the multipipe component in grasshopper. (Note: Multipipe is ony available in Rhino 7 and above).
