This envelope offers an environment for heat to naturally produce through the radiation of the sun. Similar to a greenhouse and igloo, the glass paneling rises the temperature within the structure and allows the heat to insulate through its formal language. In the same breath, openings provide cross ventilation to ensure proper temperature air levels. Additionally the envelopeâ€™s exterior system uses louvers to control radiation from the sunny condition of the site. These louvers follow the direction of the position of the sun, meaning there is flexibility in the position and orientation of the envelope system. Comfort is of high priority to allow students of the campus ample opportunity to have good working conditions outside, whether they want to take refuge from the shade during summer, or work on the tables under the envelope system during the spring time.

## Instructions for Use

This project uses a _Grasshopper_ script&mdash; which is a file that contains the algorithm to generatively design our spaceframe. You must have Rhino X to open the `.3dm` file.

**Dependencies**

The _Grasshopper_ script uses:
  - Lunchbox

Install these dependencies and then open the `.gh` file in Rhino3D.
