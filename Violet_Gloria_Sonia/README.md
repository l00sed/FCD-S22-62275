Located on CMU's CFA lawn and oriented along the sidewalk across the fence, the pavilion is designed to provide a space of minimal shade and shelter. The fa√ßade is made of sectioned off panels whose angles and translucency are determined by solar movement as well as allowing airflow within the space. The design follows organic folding surfaces towards a triangular center with the addition of stairs multi-use for seating. The pavilion sits on a shallow slope and one can enter through both directions as well as walk and set up the set of stairs. We focused on the directionality and performance of sunlight through these angled panels however we implemented an additional feature where at the center of the triangle of space, there is a tree planted. Closer design studies examines how one node of the space frame truss works.

## Instructions for Use

This project uses a _Grasshopper_ script&mdash; which is a file that contains the algorithm to generatively design our spaceframe. You must have Rhino 7 to open the `.3dm` file.

**Dependencies**

The _Grasshopper_ script uses:
  - Lunchbox
  - Pufferfish
  - Ladybug

Install these dependencies and then open the `.gh` file in Rhino3D.
