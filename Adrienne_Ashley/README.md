This is an example project in the FCD S22 repo. It is meant to demonstrate the correct format and content expected for uploading materials. This area is used to reiterate the project description from my M6 submission. This project explores responsive architecture through designing a space frame system composed with a panelized
component. The performance and fabrication furthered our study in understanding tectonics and design builds. The system is driven by solar radiation, allowing the sun to activate the experience. Our installation arches over a flight of stairs next to the College of Fine Arts building. It elevates the space utilizing light and manipulation of hexagonal geometries. Most prominently altering the spatial experience is our use of color in combination with the way the sun hits the tinted glass
surfaces at different angles, projecting multicolored shapes onto the stairs, and even the walls and ground around it; depending on the different times of day. Since this area is mostly grass, the protrusions on the sides of the structure also create sitting nooks/spaces for students to rest and enjoy the outside.
**Contents**

- [M6](file:///C:/Users/ashle/Downloads/m6_ashleyadrienne-1.pdf) of M6 submission
- additional `.gifs` or animated content
- `.gh` script file
- `.3dm` CAD model file
- this `.md` README

## Instructions for Use

This project uses a _Grasshopper_ script&mdash; which is a file that contains the algorithm to generatively design our spaceframe. You must have Rhino X to open the `.3dm` file.

**Dependencies**

The _Grasshopper_ script uses:
  - Lunchbox
  - Ladybug
  - Pufferfish

Install these dependencies and then open the `.gh` file in Rhino3D.
