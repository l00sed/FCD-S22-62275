This website can be used to view the Spring 2022 _Fundamentals of Computational Design_ final projects. The course is taught at the School of Architecture at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). The Spring 2022 class has been responding to a prompt that began with the design of a parametrically-driven spaceframe that is responsive to natural light.

## Responsive Architecture

One of the requirements of the spaceframe is that it be sited somewhere in the immediate surrounds of the _College of Fine Arts_ on CMU's campus. It must follow the description of a "spaceframe" structure. Students should consider at least one functional program to their pavilion&mdash; this could be as simple as an area to read or rest.

## Fabrication

Students have begun to think very carefully about the assembly of their spaceframe structure. They are using detail drawings and advanced line-drawing techniques to produce a rigorous set of documents that careful describe the composition and assembly of their structure.

## Publication

Students are preparing their drawings sets for publication. They have carefully documented their pavilion in its entirety and have begun to also document their digital workflow and files. Finally, students have compiled all the artifacts of their digital workflow&mdash; their _Grasshopper_ scripts, 3D models, simulations and digital drawings&mdash; into an organized database.

This is a final exercise in computational design to understand contemporary modes of versioning information as well as ways that it can be productively studied and shared.
